# ‚ö° Spittoon-Draft

**Real-time AI-powered writing enhancement with streaming transformations**

> Part of the NSL (Narrative Spittoon Language) ecosystem - powerful, low-cost tools for narrative generation and enhancement.

Spittoon-Draft is an innovative writing tool that combines human creativity with AI enhancement in real-time. Select any text and watch as AI transforms it inline, or use split-view mode to see original and enhanced text side-by-side. With support for NSL narrative buckets, multiple view modes, and character-by-character streaming, Spittoon-Draft creates a unique collaborative writing experience.

## üåü Part of the NSL Ecosystem

Spittoon-Draft is one of three powerful tools in the NSL ecosystem:

- **[Spittoon-Scribe.oragenai.com](https://spittoon-scribe.oragenai.com/)** - Narrative bucket management and story generation
- **[Spittoon-UNO.oragenai.com](https://spittoon-uno.oragenai.com/)** - Unified narrative operator, with semantic echo
- **[Spittoon-Draft](https://github.com/MushroomFleet/Spittoon-Draft)** (this tool) - Real-time AI text enhancement with streaming

All tools are built on the **[NSL 1.1 Specification](docs/ref/NSL-1.1-specification.md)**, [a production-ready XML-based format](https://github.com/MushroomFleet/NSL-narrative-spittoon-language) for narrative generation projects. Model performance across these tools is validated through the **[NSL-Benchmark](https://github.com/MushroomFleet/Remembering-NSL-benchmark)**, where various AI models are tested for quality, speed, and cost-effectiveness.

### üí° Recommended Setup

For optimal results with low costs, we recommend **Grok 4 Fast** at the time of publishing. According to NSL-Benchmark testing, Grok 4 Fast delivers:
- Excellent writing quality
- Fast streaming response times
- Competitive pricing
- Reliable performance across narrative tasks

Other compatible models include Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4 Turbo, and any OpenRouter-supported model.

## üìñ How to Use Spittoon-Draft

### Single View Workflow (Recommended)

The primary way to use Spittoon-Draft for most writing tasks.

#### 1. Start Writing

Type your content naturally in the editor:

```
The detective walked into the office. It was late.
She looked at the files on her desk. The phone rang.
```

#### 2. Select Text to Enhance

Highlight any portion of text you want to improve - a sentence, paragraph, or multiple paragraphs:

```
[SELECT TEXT]
The detective walked into the office. It was late.
She looked at the files on her desk.
```

#### 3. Press Ctrl+E

Press **`Ctrl+E`** (or click the **Enhance** button) to start the transformation. Watch the processing highlight:

```
[PROCESSING...]
The detective walked into the office. It was late.
She looked at the files on her desk.
```

#### 4. See the Enhancement

The selected text is replaced inline with the enhanced version:

```
Detective Sarah Chen stepped through the frosted glass door,
the click of her heels echoing in the empty office. The amber
glow of street lights filtered through venetian blinds, casting
long shadows across the case files on her mahogany desk.
```

#### 5. Keep Writing

Continue writing, select more text, and enhance as you go. Multiple enhancements can process simultaneously.

---

### Split View Workflow

Alternative workflow for comparing original and enhanced text side-by-side.

#### 1. Switch to Split View

Use the view mode selector in the header to switch to Split View mode.

#### 2. Type in Left Panel

Write your content in the left editor panel:

```
The detective walked into the office. It was late.
She looked at the files on her desk.
```

#### 3. Press Ctrl+E to Detect Paragraphs

Press **`Ctrl+E`** to detect and queue all complete paragraphs for enhancement. Paragraphs must be separated by blank lines.

#### 4. Watch the Transformation

Enhanced text streams into the right panel with wave animation. The queue system processes up to 3 paragraphs simultaneously.

---

### Bucket View Workflow

For narrative projects requiring consistent context.

#### 1. Import NSL Bucket

Click the **Import** button and select an NSL (`.nm3` or `.xml`) file containing your narrative context.

#### 2. Browse Bucket Contents

View imported files organized by category:
- **Framework**: Story structure, themes, rules
- **World**: Settings, locations, lore
- **Character**: Character profiles, relationships
- **Document**: Plot outlines, scene lists

#### 3. Edit as Needed

Click any file to view or edit its contents. Changes are saved automatically.

#### 4. Switch to Enhancement

Return to Single or Split view to write. The bucket context is automatically included in all enhancement requests for better consistency.

### Advanced Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Story Writing

**Input:**
```
Tom was scared. He heard a noise upstairs. 
He didn't know what to do.


He slowly walked to the stairs.
```

**Enhanced Output (with "Add Creativity" preset):**
```
Fear clutched at Tom's chest like icy fingers as the sound 
echoed from above‚Äîa slow, deliberate creaking that sent shivers 
racing down his spine. His mind raced through possibilities, 
each more terrifying than the last. Should he run? Call for help? 
His body froze, caught between instinct and indecision.

With trembling legs and a heart hammering against his ribs, 
Tom forced himself toward the staircase. Each step felt like 
an eternity, the darkness above seeming to grow deeper, more 
menacing with every breath.
```

#### Example 2: Technical Writing Enhancement

**Input:**
```
The API returns data in JSON format. You need to parse it.
Use the fetch method to get the data.


Error handling is important.
```

**Enhanced Output (with "Professional Tone" preset):**
```
The API endpoint delivers responses in JSON format, requiring 
proper parsing for data extraction. Implement the fetch() method 
to retrieve data asynchronously, ensuring your application handles 
the Promise-based response appropriately.

Robust error handling is critical for production applications. 
Implement try-catch blocks and validate response status codes 
to gracefully handle network failures, timeout scenarios, and 
invalid data structures.
```

#### Example 3: Blog Post Creation

**Input:**
```
Morning routines are important. They help you start the day right.
Many successful people have morning routines.


You should try creating one.
```

**Enhanced Output (with "Enhance Clarity" preset):**
```
Establishing a consistent morning routine is a cornerstone of 
productivity and well-being. These structured beginnings set a 
positive tone for the entire day, creating momentum that carries 
through your most challenging tasks. Research shows that 
high-achievers across industries‚Äîfrom CEOs to athletes‚Äîcredit 
their morning rituals as fundamental to their success.

Creating your own morning routine doesn't require dramatic 
lifestyle changes. Start small: identify three meaningful 
activities that energize and focus you, then commit to them 
daily. Whether it's meditation, exercise, journaling, or simply 
enjoying coffee in silence, the key is consistency and intention.
```

### Pro Tips

**For Single View Mode:**
1. **Select Strategically** - Enhance sentences, paragraphs, or entire sections based on your needs
2. **Iterate Gradually** - Enhance one section, review, then move to the next for better control
3. **Use Processing Highlights** - Watch the visual feedback to track active enhancements
4. **Try Different Selections** - Experiment with enhancing different amounts of text

**For Split View Mode:**
5. **Separate Paragraphs** - Use blank lines to separate paragraphs for proper detection with `Ctrl+E`
6. **Monitor the Queue** - Watch status lights (yellow/blue/green) to pace your writing
7. **Keep Writing** - Continue writing while previous paragraphs process (up to 3 concurrent)

**For All Modes:**
8. **Experiment with Prompts** - Different enhancement styles yield different results (UNO, Creative, Professional, etc.)
9. **Import Buckets** - Use NSL buckets for consistent character voices and world-building
10. **Adjust Temperature** - Lower (0.3-0.7) for consistency, higher (1.0-1.5) for creative variation
11. **Use Descriptive Language** - Give the AI context about tone, setting, and emotion in your draft
12. **Save Your Work** - Copy enhanced text regularly (export feature coming soon)
