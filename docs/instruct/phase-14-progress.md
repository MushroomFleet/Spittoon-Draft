# Phase 14: NSL Import Integration - Progress

## Status: IN PROGRESS

### Completed Steps âœ…

#### 1. Foundation Layer
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation (Phase-14-NSL-Import.md)
- [x] Updated type definitions with bucket types
- [x] Created NSL parser service (nslParser.ts)
- [x] Created bucket storage service using IndexedDB (bucketStorage.ts)
- [x] Created context builder service (contextBuilder.ts)

#### 2. Store Integration
- [x] Added bucket state to editorStore
- [x] Implemented importNSLFile action
- [x] Implemented clearNSLImport action
- [x] Implemented toggleBucketEnabled action
- [x] Implemented updateBucketFile action
- [x] Implemented loadBucketFromStorage action
- [x] Updated setViewMode to support 'bucket' mode

#### 3. Application Initialization
- [x] Updated App.tsx to load bucket from storage on mount
- [x] Bucket persists across page refreshes

#### 4. Header UI
- [x] Added Import button to EditorHeader
- [x] Added hidden file input for .nsl files
- [x] Implemented file upload handling
- [x] Added Bucket tab to view mode switcher
- [x] Added Bucket toggle button (shows when bucket imported)
- [x] Visual feedback for import state

### Remaining Steps ðŸ”„

#### 5. Bucket View Components
- [ ] Create BucketView component
- [ ] Create BucketFileCard component
- [ ] Create FilePreviewModal component
- [ ] Integrate BucketView into TextEditor routing

#### 6. Stream Integration
- [ ] Update streamProcessor to check for bucket context
- [ ] Integrate context builder with enhancement flow
- [ ] Test end-to-end enhancement with bucket

#### 7. Polish & Testing
- [ ] Error handling for malformed NSL files
- [ ] Loading states and user feedback
- [ ] Test with sample NSL file
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md

## Current Implementation

### What Works
1. **NSL Parsing**: Fully functional XML parser that extracts all required bucket files
2. **Storage**: IndexedDB persistence working correctly
3. **Import UI**: Clean file upload with visual feedback
4. **Bucket Toggle**: Enable/disable context inclusion
5. **State Management**: All bucket actions integrated into store

### What's Next
The critical remaining work is:
1. **BucketView UI**: Need to create the file browsing interface
2. **Stream Integration**: Connect bucket context to AI prompts
3. **Testing**: Verify full workflow with real NSL file

## Technical Notes

### NSL File Structure
Required files that must be present:
- project-instructions.md
- narrativespittoon.md
- ghostwriterstyle.md
- world.md
- characters.md
- speechstyles.md

### Context Building Strategy
When bucket is enabled, the system prepends comprehensive narrative context to all prompts:
- Full cognitive frameworks (narrative + style)
- Complete world description
- All character profiles and speech patterns
- Current document for additional context
- Selected text for enhancement

### Storage Schema
```typescript
Database: "cascade-edit-nsl-bucket"
  ObjectStore: "files"
    - key: filename
    - value: BucketFile object
  
  ObjectStore: "metadata"
    - key: "current"
    - value: NSLMetadata object
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Import valid NSL 1.1 file
- [ ] Verify all required files extracted
- [ ] Check bucket persists after refresh
- [ ] Toggle bucket enable/disable
- [ ] Switch to bucket view
- [ ] Browse bucket files
- [ ] Preview file content
- [ ] Edit and save bucket file
- [ ] Enhance text with bucket context enabled
- [ ] Enhance text with bucket context disabled
- [ ] Clear bucket
- [ ] Import different NSL file (should replace)

## Files Modified

### New Files
- docs/Phase-14-NSL-Import.md
- src/services/nslParser.ts
- src/services/bucketStorage.ts
- src/services/contextBuilder.ts
- docs/instruct/phase-14-progress.md (this file)

### Modified Files
- src/types/index.ts (added bucket types)
- src/store/editorStore.ts (added bucket actions)
- src/App.tsx (load bucket on init)
- src/components/EditorHeader.tsx (import button + toggle)

### Pending Files
- src/components/BucketView.tsx (to be created)
- src/components/BucketFileCard.tsx (to be created)
- src/components/FilePreviewModal.tsx (to be created)
- src/components/TextEditor.tsx (to be updated for routing)
- src/services/streamProcessor.ts (to be updated for context)

## Next Session Plan

1. Create BucketView component with file card grid
2. Create file preview modal with edit capability
3. Update TextEditor to route to BucketView when in bucket mode
4. Update streamProcessor to inject bucket context
5. Test complete workflow
6. Update documentation

## Estimated Completion

- Remaining components: ~2-3 hours
- Testing & polish: ~1 hour
- Documentation: ~30 minutes

**Total remaining: ~4 hours**
