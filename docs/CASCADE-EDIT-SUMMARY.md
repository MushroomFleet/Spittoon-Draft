## How to Use This Unfolded Plan

### For Project Managers
1. **Review Phase 0** for complete project understanding
2. **Assign phases** to developers based on expertise
3. **Track progress** using phase completion checklists
4. **Monitor dependencies** between phases
5. **Adjust timeline** based on actual completion times

### For Developers
1. **Start with Phase 0** to understand the big picture
2. **Complete phases sequentially** (1 → 2 → 3 → ...)
3. **Follow each phase document** step by step
4. **Check off completion items** as you progress
5. **Commit work** after each phase completion
6. **Document issues** in troubleshooting sections

### For Team Leads
1. **Conduct daily standups** reviewing current phase
2. **Unblock developers** using troubleshooting sections
3. **Code review** at phase completion points
4. **Ensure quality** using verification checklists
5. **Update timelines** based on actual progress

## Creating Remaining Phase Documents

To create the remaining phase documents (Phases 3-10), ask Claude:

**For Phase 3:**
```
"Create Phase 3 (State Management & Store Implementation) using the Unfold methodology. Include complete Zustand store implementation with paragraph detection, queue management, and all state actions. Keep under 45,000 characters."
```

**For Phase 4:**
```
"Create Phase 4 (OpenRouter API Integration & Streaming) using the Unfold methodology. Include StreamProcessor class, SSE handling, queue management, and complete error handling. Keep under 45,000 characters."
```

**Continue pattern for remaining phases...**

---

## Substage Creation (Optional)

For complex phases (especially Phases 4, 5, 6), you may want to create substages:

**Example: Phase 4 Substages**
- Substage 4.1: Basic StreamProcessor Setup
- Substage 4.2: SSE Parsing and Chunk Handling  
- Substage 4.3: QueueManager Implementation
- Substage 4.4: Error Handling and Retry Logic
- Substage 4.5: Integration Testing

To create substages:
```
"Unfold Phase 4 into substages using the Unfold methodology. Create Substage 4.1 (Basic StreamProcessor Setup) with detailed implementation steps."
```

---
